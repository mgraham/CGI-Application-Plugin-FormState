Revision history for CGI-Application-Plugin-FormState

0.12_3  
        - changed explicit use of HTML::Template to $tmpl_class
        
0.12_2  
        - Added failing test case for CAP::TT with new die_on_bad_params code.

        - Changes of interest to module maintainers only:
          - t/prereqs-scenarios is now included in the distribution.  
            
            This is how I simulate the absense of specific modules 
            (e.g. CAP::TT) when running the test suite.  

            To test the various prerequisite scenarios, use the included 
            prove-prereqs.pl script:

              ./misc/prove-prereqs.pl t/prereq_scenarios -Ilib t/

            This runs the test suite several times.  Each time it simulates
            a different set of unavailable modules.

            Adapted from the Perl Hacks book.
           

0.12_1  
        - EXPERIMENTAL FEATURE
          If the templating system in use is HTML::Template, and if the 
          template has die_on_bad_params set, then FormState will now 
          refrain from setting the cap_form_state storage variable into 
          the template if the value does not exist in the template.
          Thanks to AlexanderBecker (RT #50076)

        - Fixed typos in POD.  Thanks to Lyle Hopkins (COSMICNET) (RT #43470).

        - Changes of interest to module maintainers only:
          - source repo now on github: http://github.com/mgraham/CAP-FormState
          - fixed the makedocs script to work with more recent pod2html

0.12    Nov 16, 2005
        - added Makefile.PL compatibility to the distribution

0.11    Oct 05, 2005
        - fixed a serious bug where calling 'delete' before calling
          'param' could clear all values in the user's session

        - 'session_key', 'id' and 'name' now all automatically configure
          the form_state if it hasn't been configured yet.

0.10    Oct 03, 2005
        - removed the need to call 'init'
        - default form storage name is now 'cap_form_state'
        - allowed a form_state storage to be populated and queried in
          the same request
        - added CGI::Application version 4.0 as a prerequisite
        - accepted params from url_param as well as from param
        - made CGI version 2.37 or greater a prerequisite (for url_param)
        - added informative error message if hooks cannot be installed
          on module load.
